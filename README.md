# personal_dashboard_backend_heroku

## Purpose

For getting the backend of my Personal Dashboard hosted on Heroku.

See https://github.com/JamieBort/PersonalDashboard/blob/host/Progress.md#status

## Status

See the status of each attemptXX/readme.md file

I started with `attempt01/`

But am now working in `attempt00/`.
`attempt00/` **worked**.

If `attempt01/` doesn't work, 
then copy `attempt00/` into `attempt02/`. 
And then build/add `original/` into `attempt02/`.
